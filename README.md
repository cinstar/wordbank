# wordbank
## Inspiration
Ever had to search for an esoteric word from your British television over and over again? Like "esoteric"? Or stumbled upon terms you've never heard before in a research paper you need to understand?

## What it does
Our Google Chrome extension Wordbank It! lets you save any word to your word bank for future reference. Just highlight a word, and a sidebar pops up with definitions from Dictionary.com. You can then store the word, alongside a custom note/definition/sentence it was used in.

Additionally, your saved words will be highlighted if they appear on a webpage in the future!

## Future updates
Moving forward, we hope to integrate AI/ML into our extension to generate vocab quizzes to test for comprehension as well as a list of related words.
