# Wordbank
This was our submission to the SB Hacks X hackathon: you can find the submission here. https://devpost.com/software/wordbank

This Google Chrome extension lets you save any word to your word bank for future reference. Just highlight a word, and a sidebar pops up with definitions from Dictionary.com. You can then store the word, alongside a custom note/definition/sentence it was used in.

Some features that we would consider implementing in the future are integrating AI/ML into our extension to generate vocab quizzes to test for comprehension as well as a list of related words, and having the ability to highlight a user's saved words if they appear on a webpage in the future.
